# Coding Temple React E-Commerce App
Individual coding temple project to learn how to use React for front-end of a webapp, and Flask for backend. To get additional experience, I incorporated Material UI.

Backend for project is stored in repo below

https://github.com/tylerob65/Coding-Temple-React-E-Commerce-Backend

## The Assignment
Build an e-commerce application with the following things to be included:
(You can add this on to the To-Do or the React Finstagram app we've been building in class, since they both should have user authentication)


- A user should be able to sign up
- A route that shows a list of all available products
- When you click on a product it should be able to link to a route which shows a single product (with the information of the product you just clicked)
- User should be able to add a product to their cart, but only if they are logged in
- A route (cart) that shows a list of products youâ€™ve added into your cart as well as the total of all the items in your cart
- Add a route that, when clicked handles functionality that removes all items from your cart one time. Also create a button that, when pressed, it removes that specific product object from the cart.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
